# RestAPI assignment

This is an assignment for KodeHode where I created a RestAPI (MVC) and wrote down some reflections on how RestAPIs work and the use of models (in norwegian).
I didn't really have any bright ideas for what to make for the API, so I landed on something inoffensive like search engines, and I ended up using ChatGPT to generate a small description of the search engines for me.

I used thunderclient to test the post method, and wrote the results into a json file under the Test folder.
